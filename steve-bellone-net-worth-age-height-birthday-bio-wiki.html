Failing and unmaintained septic systems and cesspools have created an excess amount of nitrogen pollution in the region’s water supply, becoming a serious threat to Long Island’s water quality, wildlife, quality of life; and has already decimated the once iconic shellfish industry. Nitrogen poisoning has additionally destroyed the region’s coastal vegetation, which acts as a natural habitat for marine and aviary life as well as a natural buffer against devastating storm surges as seen during Superstorm Sandy. The County has identified 360,000 unsewered homes that contribute to nearly 70% of the nitrogen pollution load, and has developed an actionable, long term plan to sewer targeted areas, fortify existing waste water infrastructure, and bring advanced on-site waste water treatment systems to residential properties that are contributing most to the nitrification of waters. To date, Bellone has worked extensively with state and federal officials to secure a historic investment of more than $380 million and is seeking further funding to help reduce excess nitrogen pollution, invest in wastewater infrastructure and help to protect coastal vegetation and marshlands.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Steve Bellone height</b> Not available right now.

Using the same economic policies instituted in the Town of Babylon to restore fiscal balance, the Bellone administration reduced Suffolk’s deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars. The 2015 budget proposal recommends actions to eliminate the budget deficit completely. The Suffolk County deficit currently stands at $89.9 million, a reduction of $411 million in two years.</p><p align=justify>Since Bellone took office, the administration has enacted a series of government reforms and offered a variety of proposals to improve government efficiencies while maintaining reduced staffing levels. Since 2010, County staffing has reduced by more than 1,100 employees and has achieved annual reoccurring savings of over $100 million as a result. The reduction of “one-shot” revenues has allowed Suffolk County to focus on long-term budget mitigation efforts. In addition, Bellone championed the merger of the Suffolk County Comptroller’s Office and Suffolk County Treasurer’s Office, a move estimated to save $800,000 a year that will streamline the county’s financial operations. The merger was approved by over 61% Suffolk County voters in the November 4, 2014 election. The consolidation of the two offices will take place on January 1, 2018.</p><h2>Top Facts about Steve Bellone</h2><li>Steve Bellone is an American politician serving as Suffolk County Executive.</li><li>He was first elected in 2011 and re-elected in 2015 and 2019.</li><li>Bellone is a member of the Democratic Party.</li><li>He previously served as Babylon Town Supervisor from 2002 to 2011.</li><li>Under his leadership, Suffolk County has focused on fiscal responsibility.</li><li>Bellone has prioritized environmental protection and sustainable development initiatives.</li><li>He implemented reforms to combat the opioid crisis in Suffolk County.</li><li>Bellone has been recognized for his efforts to promote affordable housing options.</li><li>He has advocated for improved transportation infrastructure within the county.</li><li>As of 2020, Bellone remains an influential figure in Long Island politics.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Steve Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Politician</strong>.

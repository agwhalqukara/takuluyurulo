This is very unfortunate for everyone involved, especially the millions of unemployed workers and struggling small businesses. On the positive side, members of the elite class are doing their part to encourage optimism during these difficult times. What exactly is Hollywood’s finest doing to stay busy in social isolation? A list of isolation activities is listed in the content provided below.</p><p><strong>Baking</strong></p><p>Celebrities like Rachel Ray are showing off their baking skills in the privacy of their homes. Martha Stewart, Ed Helms, and Ina Garten are spending the biggest portion of their day cooking while quarantined.&nbsp;</p><p>Baking is a great outlet for the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, it is a good outlet regardless of your situation. Baking has been contributed to healthier eating, better mood, entertainment, improved organization, and enhanced self-esteem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Social Media Posting</strong></p><p>There is nothing worse than being isolated away from others. Unlike the 1918 influenza epidemic, victims of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic have access to one of the greatest resources. This resource is no other than social media. In fact, fans have seen an increase in their favorite celebrities’ social media activities.&nbsp;</p><p>When fans are not playing <a href=#>online kaszinó</a>, they are monitoring celebrity social media activity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Selfies & More Selfies</strong></p><p>During the pandemic, people around the world have had a lot more time on their hands. What are these individuals going to do with their time? Many celebrities will get into trouble if they don’t stay busy. To deal with this issue, they’ve decided to take advantage of their favorite social networks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kim Kardashian and other celebrities have been busy on social networks. Check their social media accounts and you’ll notice a lot more selfies.</p><p>A lot of those selfies feature masks and that is an interesting addition. Either way, celebrity selfies have exploded during the pandemic. Since they have nothing else to do, they’ve decided to share their glamorous pictures with people from around the world.</p><p><strong>Puzzles</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, people understood that they were going to be locked down for a long time. As a result, they searched high and low for activities that would keep them busy from start to finish. Some activities proved to be more helpful than others. For many celebrities, the best solution to the problem was playing puzzles. Solving a puzzle is difficult but rewarding. Ellen DeGeneres, Patrick Stewart, and many other celebrities have been putting together puzzles during the lockdown.</p><p>Kylie Jenner and Hugh Jackman have become two more puzzle fans. They’re not the only ones. Sales of puzzles have climbed significantly higher during the pandemic. A lot of that likely has to do with celebrities posting their puzzles on social media.</p><p>Singing Together</p><p>While celebrities can’t be together physically, they can still find ways to hang out. For instance, many celebrities have started taking advantage of video chat platforms. With these services, they can chat with their celebrity friends, play games, and sing together. However, this isn’t always a good thing. Recently, Gal Gadot and her celebrity friends found themselves in hot water after singing John Lennon’s Imagine. Natalie Portman, Will Ferrell, Mark Ruffalo, and other celebrities joined Wonder Woman in singing the song together.</p><p>Others who join them included Kaia Gerber, Amy Adams, Norah Jones, Sarah Silvers, James Marsden, Kristen Wiig, and Zoe Kravitz. Gadot was trying to tell people that everyone is in this together, but fans weren’t impressed. Many said it made them cringe. Others said they should’ve donated to charities instead. Some believe that any attention is good attention, but Gal found out the hard way that this isn’t always the case.</p><p><strong>Getting Political</strong></p><p>Celebrities have never been shy about dipping their toes into politics. In fact, many celebrities are more vocal than average Americans about the current state of politics in the United States. During the pandemic, this activity was taken to a new level. Many Trump-hating celebrities were angered by Donald Trump’s acquittal during his second impeachment trial. Jon Stewart, George Takei, Alyssa Milano, and others spoke against Trump on social media. While most celebrities are left-leaning, there are a few Republican celebrities.</p><p>Some of the most notable Republican celebrities include James Woods, Dennis Miller, Adam Baldwin, and Pat Sajak.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksLDCyJ1kanFdnsCwuMCtoKimXZawtbXVoquinaNivKd506GcZqqZmLVurc2dZJ%2BZnaTCtHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcovid-19-isolation-activities-of-the-rich-and-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcovid-19-isolation-activities-of-the-rich-and-famous.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcovid-19-isolation-activities-of-the-rich-and-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcovid-19-isolation-activities-of-the-rich-and-famous.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcovid-19-isolation-activities-of-the-rich-and-famous.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcovid-19-isolation-activities-of-the-rich-and-famous.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./istanbul-resident-e-g-universal-crossword-clue.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./istanbul-resident-e-g-universal-crossword-clue.html>Istanbul resident, e.g Universal Crossword Clue</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-kristin-smart-how-did-the-cal-poly-student-die.html>What Happened to Kristin Smart?

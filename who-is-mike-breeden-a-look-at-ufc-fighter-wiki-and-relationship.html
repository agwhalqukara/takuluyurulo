He was not extremely athletic until his teens since he was a fat child who wanted to follow in his parents’ footsteps and work in a restaurant.&nbsp;Mike’s path was altered when his uncle advised him to attempt martial arts. He agreed at first but left after finding it difficult to work out frequently.</p><p>“I just really didn’t enjoy working out back then,” he said. You couldn’t make me flee. You couldn’t make me lift. You couldn’t make me do anything if it didn’t include food.”</p><p>His uncle, on the other hand, continued pushing him, dragging him to the gym and guiding him through his MMA adventure. In 2014, he faced Devon Webber in his first major match, which he lost in the third round.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mike-Breeden-2.jpg alt="Mike Breeden" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Mike Breeden’s Wife: Is He Married?</h2><p>The professional boxer has been married to his wife, Miriam Joy For almost a year.

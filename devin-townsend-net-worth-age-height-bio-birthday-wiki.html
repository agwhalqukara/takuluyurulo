Who is Devin Townsend dating now & how much money does Devin Townsend have?</p><h2>Devin Townsend Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Devin Townsend</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Guitarist</strong> who was born on <strong>May 5, 1972</strong> in New Westminster, British Columbia, <strong>Canada</strong>. Singer, songwriter, founder and guitarist for the metal group Strapping Young Lad. Strapping Young Lad.</p><p>His unique sound and style has been compared to that from&nbsp;His signature sound and delivery has been compared with that of <a href=#>Frank Zappa</a>..</p><p>Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician, songwriter and record producer. He founded extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad and was its primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist from 1994 to 2007, and has an extensive career as a solo artist. After performing in a number of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai’s album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.</p><p>Townsend played ESP six and seven-string guitars from 1994 to 2009 during his endorsement with ESP. In the early days of Strapping Young Lad, he was seen playing an ESP Flying V-style 6-string with a single EMG 81 pickup and a custom graphic designed by Townsend. This was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, and the shows in support of City. In addition to this guitar, Townsend also utilized an ESP EXP Explorer-style guitar with two EMG 81 pickups. During the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was also seen with two ESP Telecaster models (one white, one black) with EMG 81 pickups, which were used for the majority of his six-string material. Townsend also utilized two ESP Custom Shop Horizon 7-string guitars with a 27″ baritone scale and EMG 81-7 pickups, which closely resembled ESP’s Stephen Carpenter signature model. He has also been seen with the Stephen Carpenter SC-607 and SC-607B. He was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS during Accelerated Evolution and Synchestra-era shows (mainly for performing “Deadhead”). At the time, this was the only guitar Devin Townsend was seen with that did not have EMG pickups, but was modified with a Seymour Duncan STK-S2n Hot Stack in the neck.</p><p align=justify>He was married Tracy Turner when he was 19 years old. They have a son called Reyner Liam Johnstan.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Devin Townsend</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Devin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Townsend</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Westminster</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>British Columbia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tracy Turner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Devin Townsend ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Relativity Records responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album, Promise. Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician Steve Vai. Impressed with Townsend’s vocal work, Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album Sex & Religion. After recording Sex & Religion, Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album. Townsend soon landed a second touring gig, this time with the opening band of Vai’s tour, the Wildhearts. He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in Europe, and appeared as a guest musician on their single Urge. Ginger, the band’s frontman, remained close friends with Townsend, later co-writing several songs on Infinity and the Christeen + 4 Demos EP.</p><h2>Devin Townsend Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Devin Townsend is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from Canada. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Devin Townsend</b>'s net worth <strong>$2 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>At age five, He began playing banjo at five years old at the age of five; by 12 he was switching to guitar.</p><p align=justify>It was not too long after graduating from his high school graduation for him feel dissatisfied with the music industry and decided to create music for himself.</p><p align=justify>Devin Townsend was born in New Westminster, British Columbia, on May 5, 1972. Townsend picked up the banjo when he was five, and began playing guitar when he was 12. As an early teenager he befriended Brian “Beav” Waddell, who would later play guitars as part of the Devin Townsend Band and bass on the Devin Townsend Project. He participated in several metal bands while he was in high school, and founded Grey Skies at the age of 19. Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought, replacing Jed Simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist Byron Stroud, both of whom would later become members of Townsend’s flagship band, Strapping Young Lad. In 1993, Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes, a project he later described as “just as violent as Strapping Young Lad”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For Strapping Young Lad and solo projects from 1996 – 2004, Townsend mainly used the Peavey 5150 head, with Mesa Boogie and Marshall 4×12 cabinets, for his main sounds. Around 2005, Townsend began to utilize Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and Stiletto amp heads, boosted with a Maxon OD808, running into Mesa/Boogie 2×12 cabinets, and Marshall 4×12 cabinets. He would also run a 3rd signal into a 1990s Roland GP-100, which would be amplified by a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. He would still make use of the Peavey head for some solo recordings, such as Synchestra. He switched to a Fractal Audio AxeFx system in 2010, replacing his entire Mesa/Boogie and Marshall rig. He has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echo/reverb effects, something that Townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound. One of his favorites is the Roland GP-100, a unit that Townsend still uses along with his Fractal units. He also used a TC Electronic G-Force in tandem with his Mesa/Boogie rig. Townsend also utilizes D’Addario Strings (.010-.052 and .010-.060) and Planet Waves Custom Series cables.</p><p>Following the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded his first solo album in 1996 entitled Punky Brüster – Cooked on Phonics. Written and recorded in under a month, the album was produced as a parody of punk rock bands and documents the act of selling out for mainstream success. Townsend founded his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records, to release the album. Townsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record City, including prolific metal drummer Gene Hoglan, along with Townsend’s former bandmates Jed Simon on guitar and Byron Stroud on bass. The industrial-influenced album was released in 1997. To this day, the album is widely considered Strapping Young Lad’s best work, with Metal Maniacs calling it “groundbreaking” and Revolver naming it “one of the greatest metal albums of all time”. Townsend himself considers it the band’s “ultimate” album. Later that year, Townsend released his second solo album, Ocean Machine: Biomech. The album featured a mix of hard rock, ambient, and progressive rock.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Devin Townsend height</b> Not available right now.

He agreed to a five-album deal with the record label, and also provided much of the guitar work on the 1994 album Millennium and the 1995 album Hard Wired by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly. Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. “At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn’t the best publicity to have,” he later explained. “I was playing somebody else’s music and I was judged in respect to that music.” Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, which was released in April 1995.</p><p align=justify>Townsend has revealed in interviews that he suffers from depression. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around 1998, a condition that was unknowingly exacerbated by his alcohol and drug use at the time; he has been sober and free of anti-psychotic medication since 2007.</p><h2>Who is Devin Townsend Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Devin Townsend</strong> married to <strong>Tracy Turner</strong>.

He explained, “I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand.” In December 1997, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder “gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping’s City record and Ocean Machine: Biomech.” After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that “everything just clicked” and he was able to write his third solo album, Infinity, which he described as “the parent project” of City and Ocean Machine: Biomech, with music influenced by Broadway. Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. Infinity was released in October 1998. Later in his career, Townsend has cited Infinity as his favorite solo record.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Devin Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in Canada</strong>. Devin Townsend celebrates birthday on May 5 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Townsend’s next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called Fizzicist, which they described as “heavier than Strapping Young Lad”. When the IR8 tape was leaked, Newsted’s Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich learned of the project. Hetfield was “fucking pissed” that Newsted was playing outside the band, and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects, although Townsend would later downplay Metallica’s role in Newsted’s unavailability. With the project stalled, Townsend instead wrote the album himself, entitling it Physicist. Townsend assembled his Strapping Young Lad bandmates to record it, the only time this lineup was featured on a Devin Townsend album. The thrash-influenced Physicist was released in June 2000, and is generally considered a low point in Townsend’s career. Hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed, and Townsend considers it his worst album to date.</p><h3>Is Devin Townsend sober?</h3><p>Three years ago, not long after the birth of his son, DEVIN TOWNSEND resolved to quit drinking and smoking pot.

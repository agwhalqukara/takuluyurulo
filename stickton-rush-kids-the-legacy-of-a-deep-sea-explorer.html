<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was Stockton Rush?</h2><p>Stockton Rush was an American businessman and engineer, best known as the co-founder and chief executive officer of OceanGate, a deep-sea exploration company. He had a passion for aviation and aquatics since childhood, and dreamed of becoming an astronaut and the first person on Mars. He was also a descendant of two signers of the Declaration of Independence, Richard Stockton and Benjamin Rush.</p><p>Stockton Rush died on June 18, 2023, along with four others, in a tragic accident while attempting to visit the wreck of the Titanic in OceanGate’s Titan submersible. He had stated that the submersible was safe, despite its rule-defying construction. “At some point, you’re going to take some risk, and it really is a risk-reward question,” Stockton said on CBS News Sunday Morning. “I think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are Stockton Rush’s children doing now?</h2><p>Stockton Rush and his wife, Wendy, shared two children, Richard ‘Ben’ and Quincy, who appear in a photo on Wendy’s Facebook page. Richard, like his father, mother, grandfather, and great-grandfather, attended Princeton University. He graduated in 2011, building a robotic arm for submersible vehicles for his thesis. He later worked as a venture capitalist, a subsea robot engineer, and a pilot. He is currently a co-founder and CEO of a technology startup company called Pioneer Square Labs in Seattle.</p><p>Quincy, Stockton’s younger daughter, is a judicial law clerk in the United States District Court in the Central District of California. She earned her Juris Doctor degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 2020. She is also a Princeton alumna, and a former editor-in-chief of the Princeton Journal of Public and International Affairs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How are Stockton Rush’s children honoring his legacy?</h2><p>Stockton Rush’s children are honoring his legacy by pursuing their own passions and interests, while also keeping his memory alive. Richard, who inherited his father’s enthusiasm for deep-sea expeditions, has posted social media photos of himself investigating underwater wrecks. He has also expressed his admiration for his father’s courage and vision. “He was a pioneer, a visionary, and a hero. He inspired me to follow my dreams and to never give up. I miss him every day, but I know he is watching over me and cheering me on,” Richard wrote on Instagram.</p><p>Quincy, who shares her father’s love for law and justice, has dedicated her career to serving the public interest and upholding the rule of law. She has also paid tribute to her father’s adventurous spirit and generosity. “He was a man of many talents, a man of action, and a man of kindness. He taught me to be curious, to be brave, and to be compassionate. He was my role model, my mentor, and my friend. I love him with all my heart, and I hope to make him proud,” Quincy wrote on Facebook.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Stockton Rush’s children, Richard and Quincy, are the stickton rush kids who are carrying on his legacy of exploration, innovation, and leadership. They are both successful and accomplished individuals who have followed their own paths, while also honoring their father’s memory and values. They are a testament to the impact that Stockton Rush had on his family, his company, and his field. He may be gone, but he is not forgotten. He lives on through his children, and through his contributions to the world of deep-sea exploration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX6jBqq%2FKraanZaKqwKl5yqKbrGWknbJuuMSgmJyxXaSzbq2MnZyeqF2osqJ5xLGnpaeimr9w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstickton-rush-kids-the-legacy-of-a-deep-sea-explorer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstickton-rush-kids-the-legacy-of-a-deep-sea-explorer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstickton-rush-kids-the-legacy-of-a-deep-sea-explorer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstickton-rush-kids-the-legacy-of-a-deep-sea-explorer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstickton-rush-kids-the-legacy-of-a-deep-sea-explorer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstickton-rush-kids-the-legacy-of-a-deep-sea-explorer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vincent-d-onofrio-net-worth-bio-family-address-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vincent-d-onofrio-net-worth-bio-family-address-career.html>Vincent D Onofrio Net Worth | Bio, Family, Address, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sideways-actress-sandra-eugene-sheffer-crossword-clue.html>Sideways actress Sandra Eugene Sheffer Crossword Clue</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sideways-actress-sandra-eugene-sheffer-crossword-clue.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

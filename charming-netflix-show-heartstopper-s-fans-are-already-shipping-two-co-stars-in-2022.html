As directed by <strong>Euros Lyn</strong>, the series follows the queer coming-of-age drama about queer identity, love, and friendship. The show, which is set in Truham Boys School and Higgs Girls School, focuses on queer people in same-sex schools and explores the politics of their existence while intricately presenting high-school romance.</p><p>Openly gay at his school, Charlie is treated as an outsider, thus being bullied every now and then. However, a twist in his fate occurs as he is seated next to Nick Nelson, the star rugby player. One thing leads to another and the two eventually fall in love against all odds. Alongside presenting a plethora of stories, exploring sexualities and subtly educating, the main focus of the drama remains on Charlie and Nick, and the nuances of their young gay loving hearts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span ez-l=under_second_paragraph ez-s=728x90,468x60,250x250,300x250,336x280,580x400 ez-ai=true ez-dt=ad></span><p>Reviewed as unutterably sweet and wholesome by <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a>, the series received quite remarkable reviews to date.

It was painful for him.</p><p>Herein, What has happened to Kris Kristofferson?</p><p>In recent years, Kristofferson had been grappling with memory loss. In 2016, he told Rolling Stone he believed it was due to Lyme disease, which he was diagnosed with earlier that year.</p><p>Accordingly, Did Kristofferson sleep with Janis Joplin?</p><p>“I’ve got a present for you, baby,” Neuwirth said, pushing Kristofferson into Joplin’s arms. A month later, Kris was still there. Joplin had been doing heroin, but she stopped completely during her affair with Kris. “<b>I lived with her, slept with her, but it wasn’t a love affair</b>,” he tells me.</p><p>Was Bobby McGee a real person?</p><p>“Me and Bobby McGee” has become a rock classic over the years. Co-written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster, this iconic song was first conceptualized with just a title — <b>inspired by a real person</b>. Foster had a bit of a crush on Barbara “Bobbie” McKee who was a secretary on Nashville’s music row.</p><p>Consequently Who did Kris Kristofferson write Bobby McGee for?</p><p>“The title came from [producer and Monument Records founder] Fred Foster. He called one night and said, ‘I’ve got a song title for you. It’s “Me and Bobby McKee.”’ I thought he said ‘McGee. ‘ Bobby McKee was the secretary of <b>Boudleaux Bryant</b>, who was in the same building with Fred.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Was_Me_and_Bobby_Mcgee_written_about></span><strong>Who Was Me and Bobby Mcgee written about?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>1 hit for Janis Joplin. Late producer Fred Foster’s friend, songwriter Boudleaux Bryant, kept teasing him that he only visited Bryant’s offices to see his secretary, Barbara “Bobby” McKee, according to Newswire. Inspired by the wisecrack, Foster approached Kristofferson, then a young songwriter on his roster.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_a_harmonica_called_a_harpoon></span><strong>Why is a harmonica called a harpoon?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The line, “I pulled my Harpoon from my dirty red bandana” can be interpreted two ways.

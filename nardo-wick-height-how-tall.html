He has a body weight of 60 kilograms or 132 pounds, and was born on December 30, 2001, meaning that he is now 21 years old.</b></p><p>Nardi Wick (born Horace Bernard Walls III) claimed the spotlight thanks to his musical talent and his career as a rapper, which began in earnest in 2020. While his music remains what has always drawn so much attention to him, his physical features, including his height and body weight are things his fans and followers have always questioned. Here is all we know about his body stats.</p><h3><strong>Nardo Wick Height And Body Stats</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>AGE:</strong> 21 years old</li><li><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> December 30, 2001</li><li><strong>BIRTHPLACE</strong>: Jacksonville, Florida, United States</li><li><strong>BIRTH SIGN</strong>: Capricorn</li><li><strong>ETHNICITY:&nbsp;</strong>African-American</li><li><strong>HEIGHT IN INCHES</strong>: 5 feet 11 inches</li><li><strong>HEIGHT IN METERS</strong>: 1.80</li><li><strong>BODYWEIGHT IN KG</strong>: 60 kilograms</li><li><strong>BODYWEIGHT IN POUNDS</strong>: 132 lbs.</li></ul><h2><strong>How Tall Is Nardo Wick?</strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nardo Wick’s height is 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 meters or 180 centimeters), making him tall. Considering that he was born on December 30, 2001, and is now 21 years old, the Florida-born rapper will most likely not grow any taller because men stop growing tall in their late teens and early 20s.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although some reports claim his height is below 5 feet 8 inches, several other sources report that he is most likely 5 feet 10 inches. However, when compared to several other rappers who are known to be around 6 feet, he is also much closer, which means he is about 5 feet 11 inches tall.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The parents of the rapper are Horace Walls and Telicia Yvette Walls. However, it is unclear what their body features are. Needless to say, it is possible that Nardo, who is of American nationality and African-American ethnic extraction, got his great height from the genetics passed on to him by his parents.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nardo Wick’s Other Body Measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition to a good height, Nardo Wick also has good body features. As stated, he weighs 60 kilograms or 132 pounds and is of a rather slim build, although he is not athletic.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The rapper is obviously African-American and has black hair and blue eyes. That is all about his body features known as other things such as his shoe size and body measurements are still not available at the moment.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nardo Wick’s Height Makes Him Taller Than An Average American Male</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Standing at 5 feet 11 inches tall, Nardo Wick is taller than the average American male, whose height is 5 feet 9 inches. The rapper may not be the tallest man on a good day, but with an inch advantage, he has a slight edge compared to an average American.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The height difference is even more elaborate when he is put against the Average American woman whose height is around 5 feet 4 inches. This means that the rapper has an advantage of an incredible 6 inches when placed beside the average American female.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nardo Wick’s Height Compared To Other American Rappers</span></strong></h2><p>The average height of American rappers is also similar to that of an average American male, which means that when compared to that of Nardo, the rapper definitely has an edge.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are some rappers who are taller than him, while he is also taller than many others. Here is how he stands against some of his contemporaries in the music business:</p><h3><strong>Nardo Wick’s Height Makes Him Slightly Shorter Than G Herbo</strong></h3><p>Nardo Wick’s height puts him a couple of inches below fellow rapper G Herbo, who stands at &nbsp;6 feet tall or 183 centimeters. This means that the much older rapper, who was born Herbert Randall Wright III, on October 8, 1995, and is now 28 years old, is slightly taller by an inch.</p><p>The rappers collaborated in Nardo’s 2021 song Who Want Smoke?? in which he featured other rappers, including 21 Savage and Lil Durk. Looking at them in the video, they seem to be of the same height, but at a closer look, one will realize that Herbo has the edge.</p><h3><strong>21 Savage is Of The Same Height as Nardo Wick</strong></h3><p>One rapper who stands head-to-head with Nardo is 21 Savage, as the two are of the same height. <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>21 Savage’s height</a> is also 5 feet 11 inches. The real name of the rapper is Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph and he is much older, as he was born on October 22, 1992. This means he is now 31 years old.</p><p>Looking at their appearance in the aforementioned track of Nardo, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Who Want Smoke??</a>, it is clear that they have the same height and even boy build.</p><h3><strong>Nardo Wick’s Height Puts Him Significantly Taller Than Lil Baby</strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nardo Wick is taller than&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lil Baby</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;when you compare the height of the two rappers. While, as indicated, the height of Nardo is 5 feet 11 inches, the height of Lil Baby is only 5 feet 7 inches tall. Lil Baby, born Dominique Armani Jones on December 3, 1994, may be the older of the two rappers as he is now age dob=”19941203″] years old, but height-wise, he doesn’t have the advantage.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The rappers collaborated on Lil Baby’s 2022 track Pop Out, in which he was featured. In the video of the track, it is clear that their height is significantly different, with Nardo being the taller.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He Does Not Have An Elaborate Workout Routine</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unlike rappers such as Gucci Mane, who take fitness and workout seriously, Nardo Wick does not have a serious workout routine. A look at the rapper will indicate that he does not have six packs or a ripped body, suggesting he is not a fitness enthusiast.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>More so, no information is available in the public domain to show his activities to keep fit apart from stage performance, which gets him active.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nardo Wick’s Diet Routine Is Also Not Strict</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Just as it is with the workout routine of the rapper, Nardo does not seem to have a known diet plan that is revealed to the public. All that is believed now is that he eats healthy, which is why he can maintain a good body build and keep in shape.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Since he is a famous individual, he has kept a lot of other details about his life private, which is one of the main reasons why information about his dieting habits and other routines remains away from the public domain.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLuivsOoZLChk6B6qbHIoJ%2BtZZikxG7AwKWjaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnardo-wick-height-how-tall.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnardo-wick-height-how-tall.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnardo-wick-height-how-tall.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnardo-wick-height-how-tall.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnardo-wick-height-how-tall.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnardo-wick-height-how-tall.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nolan-cromwell-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nolan-cromwell-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Nolan Cromwell Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ja-morant-basketball-player-age-birthday-bio-facts-family-net-worth-height-more.html>Ja Morant (Basketball Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ja-morant-basketball-player-age-birthday-bio-facts-family-net-worth-height-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

Now is not the time to fret, but rather the moment you get yourself to a store and pick up some of the following necessities.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: These recipes are not official Masters&nbsp;concoctions. Also, if you have issues with making a proper turkey and cheese on wheat, go ahead and slap yourself in the face one time for me. Thanks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pimento Cheese</strong></p><p>I haven't had the great fortune of eating one of these bad boys, so I will go ahead and believe what a recent fan named&nbsp;Paul Clinton told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>. "I'm not a big pimento cheese eater. But last year I had one here, and my mouth was ready for it this year."</p><p>This might not be the exact Masters recipe, but it sounds like the real deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight sandwiches should get you through day one. I would advise chasing all of them with a refreshing Arnold Palmer for added effect.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiny Test Kitchen</a> provides a recipe below, because ain't nobody got time for videos.&nbsp;</p><p>1 cup Swiss cheese, about 5 oz, finely grated<br>3/4 cup American cheese, 4 oz, finely grated<br>1/4 cup mayonnaise<br>2 oz pimentos, chopped with juices<br>4 slices white bread, we used Arnold Brick Oven white bread</p><p>1. Combine all ingredients but bread. Stir vigorously for 2-3 minutes. Apply half to one slice of bread, form a sandwich with another slice. Cut through the middle, into two halves. Repeat.</p><p>2. It really is as easy as that!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PlainChicken.com</a> has you hooked up for an egg salad sandwich recipe they call the "Better Than Augusta Egg Salad," because it's not enough to make a damn good sandwich, you have to rub it in people's faces and scoff at their mediocrity.&nbsp;</p><p>6 hard-cooked eggs, diced<br>1/2 c diced celery<br>2 1/2 Tbsp mayonnaise<br>1 Tbsp vinegar<br>1/4 tsp onion powder<br>1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)<br>1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce<br>1/8 tsp pepper</p><p>To cook the eggs:</p><p>Place the eggs in a single layer in a heavy saucepan and cover with cold water by at least one inch. Add a teaspoon of salt. Leaving the pot uncovered, turn the heat to high. As soon as the water comes to a boil, turn off the heat and cover. After 10 minutes, remove the cover and run cold water over eggs for one minute.&nbsp;</p><p>To peel, gently tap each egg against the counter, turning to make a crackle pattern. Start peeling at the broad end, where there is an air pocket.</p><p>To make the egg salad: Combine all ingredients and chill.</p><p>The last part of the recipe seems to be left out, which is to go take a nap. I am glad they left that out because then we have more sandwiches to consume.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Barbecue Sandwich</strong></p><p>Try as I might, there wasn't much in the way of anyone duplicating or providing a version of this Masters classic. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MY BBQ Blog</a> did offer some pictures for those interested and gave a review that basically offered the sandwich was good but not great.&nbsp;</p><p>For those go-getters in the crowd, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here is a recipe</a> to create your own masterpiece. We went with beef instead of pork because sometimes you have to laugh at conventions and spice things up with anarchy. Now enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Masters Club</strong></p><p>For those who have never tasted a club sandwich, we will have moment of silence for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, get yourself to the store and buy enough bacon for this recipe from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Network</a>. Now, go back out and buy more bacon.&nbsp;</p><p>The easiest way to ruin this particular sandwich is to over think the entire dish. The best club I ever had was basically a bacon sandwich with just a hint of turkey in there. In fact, I think I mumbled, "Hey, there's turkey in here" right before passing out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grilled Chicken Wrap</strong></p><p>OK, you are making me sad. If you simply have to watch those ever-expanding curves of yours, we will humor your grilled chicken needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recipe for a Mexican version</a>, but you can axe the salsa if you want to be completely safe and sensible. You probably look both ways when crossing the street too, right? Thought so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Classic Chicken Sandwich</strong></p><p>Rejoice, because the chicken sandwich has returned to the Masters. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Augusta.com</a> reports on the return of a classic and the reviews vary from amazing Chick-fil-A duplicate to a mediocre crunch-less mess.&nbsp;</p><p>We can solve that because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we have a recipe</a> that will have you moonwalking out of the kitchen with a sandwich so delicious you will almost forget there is a golf tournament on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Others&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you really need the recipes to these sandwiches, do me a favor and keep it a secret. I don't want anyone to know you are having trouble figuring out where the bread goes in a turkey sandwich.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ham and Cheese on Rye</strong> â€” Any self-respecting foodie goes with Swiss cheese for their future scintillating sandwich. I will also accept Monterey Jack, but anything else and you are on your own. I won't vouch for your rebellious ways.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Veggie Wrap </strong>â€” You must be a blast at parties. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a recipe</a> that should pair well with that Almond Milk smoothie you are drinking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Turkey and Cheese on Wheat </strong>â€” See cheese recommendations above. Also, I would ask that you live a little and ditch the wheat for a less sensible but entirely delicious french roll.&nbsp;</p><p>You might also want to add bacon, which is good advice for any meal, really.&nbsp;</p><p>Hit me up on Twitter, I'll be in a food coma.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG9oYGl9dHnMmqqtnaKoerStzZ2uopuYYr%2Bmr8ipnKxloJ66prrTqGScoJWawKZ5xKCeZquRoa6lecCnm2anpJ2ys3nArp6uq6SWeqet1aipoqyVqA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmasters-sandwich-recipes-pimento-cheese-egg-salad-and-other-augusta-favorites-news-scores-high.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmasters-sandwich-recipes-pimento-cheese-egg-salad-and-other-augusta-favorites-news-scores-high.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmasters-sandwich-recipes-pimento-cheese-egg-salad-and-other-augusta-favorites-news-scores-high.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmasters-sandwich-recipes-pimento-cheese-egg-salad-and-other-augusta-favorites-news-scores-high.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmasters-sandwich-recipes-pimento-cheese-egg-salad-and-other-augusta-favorites-news-scores-high.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmasters-sandwich-recipes-pimento-cheese-egg-salad-and-other-augusta-favorites-news-scores-high.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eskom-r16-9-million-spent-on-milk-most-costly-consumable-of-2019-20.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eskom-r16-9-million-spent-on-milk-most-costly-consumable-of-2019-20.html>Eskom: R16.9 Million Spent on Milk, Most Costly Consumable of 2019/20</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./inside-kendall-jenner-s-former-la-home-now-asking-8-5m.html>Inside Kendall Jenners former LA home, now asking $8.5M</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./inside-kendall-jenner-s-former-la-home-now-asking-8-5m.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
